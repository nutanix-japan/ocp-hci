OCP: Deploy OCP Infrastructure
-------------------------------

In this section we will deploy a OCP cluster using Nutanix Calm.

As discussed in the previous section about the Calm blueprints, 

1. Blueprint 1 (XYZ_OCP_Prov_VM) - provisions a OCP provisioning VM with Calm action to deploy OCP
2. Blueprint 2 (XYZ_OCP_Master_Worker) - is called by a Calm action in ``Blueprint 1`` with all the necessary information that ``Blueprint 2`` needs to run

Since we sucessfully setup OCP provisioning VM, we have to do the following to proceed:

1. Configure OCP VM Blueprint for environment information
2. Call the ``Deploy OCP`` action in Blueprint 1 to deploy OCP cluster


Configuring OCP VM Blueprint
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this section we will configure the environemnt for the OCP VM blueprint to run. This will include the following:

- Credentials (SSH Private Key) for the services
- Confirming OCP DNS endpoint for the services 
- NICs are auto selected during execution 

.. note::

  Latest versions of Calm automatically assigns endpoint to Calm Actions if only one is present. It is important to confirm this in the lab.

#. In **Prism Central** > **Services** > **Calm**
 
#. Click on **Blueprints**
 
We need to configure network and credentials for the blueprint so it can be deployed in your HPOC/SPOC.

#. Select your Provisioning VM ``XYZ_OCP_Master_Worker`` blueprint

#. Click on **Credentials** (next to Save)

#. Copy the same **Private Key** that you generated from the previous section :ref:`prov_vm` and paste the generated primary key in the bluprints credential called **CRED**

   .. figure:: images/ocp_bp_save_cred.png

#. Click on **Save**

#. Click on **Back** to return to the blueprints main window

#. You will notice a few warnings for KUBEADMIN and KUBECONFIG variables. These can be ignored as they will be auto-generated.

Now we will check if OCP DNS endpoints are configured for the services.

#. In the blueprint's main window, expand the application and services pane

#. Click on the **Worker** service and select the **Create DNS Entry** action

   .. figure:: images/ocp_service_ep_confirm.png
   
#. Confirm that the endpoint is the **OCP DNS Integration** that you previously configured in :ref:`endpoint` section

#. Confirm  the **OCP DNS Integration**  for **Delete DNS Entry** task

#. Confirm the **OCP DNS Integration** endpoints for **Create DNS Entry** and **Delete DNS Entry** for the following services:

   - Bootstrap
   - Master

#. If the endpoint is not assigned properly, correct the condition

#. Save the blueprint and confirm there are no validation errors (warnings about KUBECONFIG and PE_PW (runtime variables) can be ignored)

Deploying OCP Cluster 
+++++++++++++++++++++

#. In **Prism Central** > **Services** > **Calm**
 
#. Click on **Applications**

#. Select your Provisioning VM ``*Initials*_PROV_VM`` application
 
   .. figure:: images/prov_vm_app.png
   
#. Click on **Manage** tab 

#. Click on the play :fa:`play` button next to **Deploy OCP** action

   .. figure:: images/ocp_deployocp_action.png

#. This will open up **Run Action: Deploy OCP** window for user inputs

#. Fill only the following details:
   
   - **Number of Workers** - 2
   - **OCP_PULL_SECRET** - download/copy pull secret this from your Red Hat Portal `Login <https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret>`_ (you will need Red Hat Portal Access)
   - **OCP_SUBDOMAIN** - Initials1 (e.g. **xyz1**) 
   - **OCP_MACHINE_NETWORK** - provide your Primary network address for your HPOC/SPOC (e.g. 10.38.2.64/26 ) - check in your cluster reservation email/webpage
   - **OCP_BP** - XYZ_OCP_Master_Worker

   .. note::

    Make sure that the **OCP_SUBDOMAIN** name is be unique for each OCP cluster you deploy with this blueprint. A DNS zone is created based on this subdomain name. 

    You can observe this in DNS in your AutoAD VM for other deployed clusters.

    .. figure:: images/ocp_xyz1_cluster_dns.png

   .. figure:: images/ocp_deploy_task_runtime_variables.png

#. Click on **Run**

#. Go to the **Audit** tab to check the stautus of the launched **Deploy OCP** action

   .. figure:: images/ocp_deploy_audit.png

#. If this action launch is succesful, you will see another application **Openshift xyz1** in the **Calm** > **Applications** in a **Provisioning** state (this might take up to 5 minutes to show up in the Web UI)
 
   .. figure:: images/ocp_app_provisioning.png

#. Click on the **Openshift xyz1** application and go to **Audit** tab

#. Observe the VM create, package install and other Calm actions 

#. This should take about 20-25 minutes

#. Meanwhile you can notice that Prism Central's event will be getting quite busy. This is a result of VMs, storage, etc,. getting provisioned by Calm using REST calls to Prism Cental

#. Once deployed the Calm application **Openshift ocp1 XYZ** will be in a running state

   .. figure:: images/ocp_prov_vm_audit.png

Now that your OCP cluster has been deployed, in the **Services** tab, lets explore the VMs (Services in Calm) and their corresponding functions.

Click on each VM (Service) will display IP addresses and **Open Terminal** options. We will be using the private key to ssh into these VMs (if required)

We have completed this section of the lab where our OCP cluster is sucessfully deployed.

We will proceed to test Day 1 operations (Scale out and Scale in) in the next section of the lab.
